/brief: 
RC type vehicles have the potential to go faster than the students can control. 
The goal of this project was to give the students an extra challenge since they will not be limited by the performance of
the vehicle. The goal of the project was introducing an Arduino-controlled RC type vehicle as a lab in the course curriculum of the senior-level Mechatronics course at Penn State,
a demonstration on how an Arduino controlled RC car operates, and an example competition for the students.
